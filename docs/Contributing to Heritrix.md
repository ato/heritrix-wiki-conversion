# Contributing to Heritrix

# How can I contribute fixes or features to Heritrix?

## Small fixes to existing functionality

Find (or create) an issue in the JIRA issue tracker, and attach your fix
in the form of a 'diff' patch.

Emailing the project list or individual developers to highlight changes
also welcome. (This might let others know the patches are available to
integrate on their own, or remind the core team of availability when
prioritizing things for inclusion in an upcoming release.)

## New features and large amounts of code

You may wish start a discussion about possible additions, or code you've
created and wish to donate, on the project list, to gather feedback and
find others interested.

You should also create a JIRA issue to describe and capture comments
about your changes, and attach the code as a patch.

## Unambiguously ensuring the project(s) may integrate your code

We don't yet have any formal contributor agreement, like the [Apache
Foundation Contributor
Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt). However, to ensure
the project has the right to include your contributions in current and
future releases under any open source license, you should include a
clear statement with your contribution that you have the right to grant
such permission, and do so in the broadest possible terms.

We recommend the following boilerplate, as adapted/excerpted from the
Apache agreement, inserted into the JIRA issue of your first
contribution under your name/login:

> I hereby grant to the project and to recipients of software
> distributed by the project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
> no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
> prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
> sublicense, and distribute my contributions and such derivative works.
>
> I represent that I am legally entitled to grant the above license.
>
> Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, I provide
> my contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
> OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
> any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
> MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

As noted in the Apache case, this grant does not change your rights to
use your own contributions for any other purpose â€“ you retain all other
rights.

## Becoming a committer

Thus far, code committers to our master source repository at Sourceforge
have all at one point been employees of the Internet Archive or other
partner institutions with an organizational commitment to the project's
development. However, any contributor who demonstrates adequate skill
and judgement through participation in project discussions and submitted
patches is eligible to become a committer. A formal process is not yet
set up; contact the IA team and project lead(s) for more info.
