# Heritrix wiki alpha-sorted pagetree

this page is simply for convenience in viewing the pagetree
alphabetically, which may be useful for browsing when deciding where and
whether or not to create a new child page, or just for scanning the
tree. **please note:** the [Heritrix](Heritrix) page wiki code has a
{pagetree} macro with **sort=position** which is important to maintain
as we put the most important items in a particular order, and we use the
pagetree feature of the wiki as the table of contents for the User's
Guide.
