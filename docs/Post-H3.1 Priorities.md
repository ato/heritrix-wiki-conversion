# Post-H3.1 Priorities

This is a tentative list of themes for post-Heritrix 3.1 development.
(Allocation to 3.1.1, 3.2.0, etc. is to be determined.)

-   friendly web configuration editor â€“ perhaps contract development of
    general jquery-Spring-beans editor?
-   rationalize file droppings/change-logging/auto-archive-to-WARC
-   improved queue reporting/graphs/alerting
-   JS/AJAX handling:
    -   \#fragment scheme
    -   helper browsers
-   project processes:
    -   update auto-build system to Jenkins
    -   restore auto-publish of Javadoc
    -   move to git
