# Development and code questions

Hi, I'm Aaron Binns, I joined the Heritrix team at the start of 2008.
Since then, I've had my nose buried in code: reading, editing, adding,
changing. During the course of my efforts, I came up with many
questions, ideas and suggestions for the rest of the team. This page is
an attempt to capture that information for the benefit of all.

Heritrix 2 developers out in the community are encouraged to contribute
to this list. Over time, common questions will be folded into a proper
FAQ, and some might be merged into other developer documentation.
Consider this document a perpetual work-in-progress.
