# page\_frontier\_import

This page allows you to import URIs into the Frontier. There are many
reasons you might want to do this:

-   To ensure certain URIs are crawled.
-   To re-crawl previously downloaded URIs that you know have changed.
-   To crawl URIs that would otherwise be out-of-scope.Â
