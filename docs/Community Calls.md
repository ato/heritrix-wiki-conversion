# Community Calls

For the benefit of the Heritrix-using web harvesting community, and also
as a forum for the participants in the Int'l Internet Preservation
Consortium's Harvesting Working Group, we plan to hold a series of
open-to-the-community conference calls about Heritrix and common
harvesting issues.

The plan is to have calls at least after each major Heritrix release,
and possibly more often, if the interest is there. We will also try to
have calls in pairs, so that there are times convenient for both
European and Pacific timezones.

The first call will occur via a 'Skypecast', at the following time:

Wednesday May 28th at 1500GMT, which is:

-   8a San Francisco
-   11a WashingtonDC
-   4p London

The call will open with a brief overview of what's new in the latest
Heritrix releases (1.14.0 and 2.0.0), and some of the priorities for
future releases. Then, it will be an open discussion of whatever
participants want to talk about.

Participating in the Skypecast only requires a current version of Skype
to participate, and accommodates up to 100 participants (with facilities
for the moderator to rotate people into speaking positions).

For now, we will try to use 'Skypecast', which only requires a current
version of Skype to participate, and accommodates up to 100
participants.

The first conference is joinable via the Skypecast site at
<https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/skypecast/detailed.html?id_talk=4439489&hash=3146927137f424b425b2>
.

(Future call scheduling, at a time convenient for other time zones, is
pending feedback and results from this first call.)
