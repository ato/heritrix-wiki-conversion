# page\_delete\_uris

This page allows you to delete URIs from the Frontier.  The Frontier
organizes URIs into queues. You can specify a regular expression to pick
what queues you want to delete URIs from. When you click the Delete
button, only queues whose names match the regular expression will be
examined.

Similarly,  you can specify a regular expression for the URIs
themselves. Only URIs that match that regular expression will be
deleted. Note that URIs that match the "Regular Expression for URIs"
will not be deleted unless they reside in a queue that matches the
"Regular Expression for Queues".
