## Abstract

Release 1.12.0 is the first of several planned releases enhancing
Heritrix with "smart crawler" functionality. In this release, the theme

crawled and stored when recrawling sites at regular intervals.

A number of other enhancements and bug fixes are also included.

Leading up to this release, Heritrix issue tracking has migrated from
Sourceforge to <http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER>.
