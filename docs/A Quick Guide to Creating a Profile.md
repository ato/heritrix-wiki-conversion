# A Quick Guide to Creating a Profile

Profiles can be created from either the Heritrix job or profile page. 
These pages display the details of a job or profile respectively.  To
create a new profile, choose a job or profile that the new profile will
to be based on.  Click on the job or profile from the Main Console
page.  The job/profile page will be displayed.  On the bottom of the
page, enter the name of the new profile in the "Copy job to" or "Copy
profile to" text box.  Select the "as profile" checkbox and then click
"copy."  A new profile will be created.  At this point you can configure
the profile the same way that a job is configured, by editing the
crawler-beans.cxml file.

**Note**

-   A profile will **not** be modified if the profile or job it was
    based on is changed.
