# Heritrix2

Heritrix 2 no longer in development

Heritrix 2 was a forward-looking successor to Heritrix 1 whose settings
architecture (custom) has been migrated to Heritrix 3 (Spring). We
recommend using Heritrix 1 for legacy crawl projects, and Heritrix 3 for
new projects.

# Heritrix 2

The major changes/improvements in Heritrix 2 are: refactoring the
settings architecture, internal and UI, to provide basis for new
functionality, plus new options for controlling the priority of URLs,
sites, and other content groupings.
