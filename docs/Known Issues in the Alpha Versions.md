# Known Issues in the Alpha Versions

-   there is no mechanism for shutting down the web ui, other than
    killing the process
    ([HER-1304](https://webarchive.jira.com/browse/HER-1304))

<!-- -->

-   many configuration and other errors using the Web UI result in a
    displayed Java stack, rather than helpful information (see
    <http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1196> and possibly
    others to come)

<!-- -->

-   some crawl configuration changes during a crawl will not trigger the
    necessary changes in crawler components (see
    <http://webteam.archive.org/jira/browse/HER-1215>)
