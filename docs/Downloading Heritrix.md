## Downloading Heritrix

We use the maven2 build system from Apache to build and distribute
Heritrix 2. You can downloaded a zip or tar.gz file containing the
complete application from our maven2 repository. Our repository is
located at:

<http://builds.archive.org:8080/maven2/org/archive/heritrix/heritrix/>

Per maven2 standards, that directory contains subdirectories for each
version of Heritrix we have released under maven2. Currently only one
version is available, 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT, so you want to pull a zip or
tar.gz file from:

<http://builds.archive.org:8080/maven2/org/archive/heritrix/heritrix/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/>

In "SNAPSHOT" versions, the files are timestamped, so you'll want to be
sure to grab the latest one. For following this tutorial, we recommend
at least the "alpha-2" release (build id
'heritrix-2.0.0-20071024.165839-74-heritrix'):
[heritrix-2.0.0-20071024.165839-74-heritrix.tar.gz](http://builds.archive.org:8080/maven2/org/archive/heritrix/heritrix/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/heritrix-2.0.0-20071024.165839-74-heritrix.tar.gz)
